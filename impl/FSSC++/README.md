To run tests and evaluations install google test and google benchmark first.

## eval
Evaluation of gen and evaluate algorithm for 32 and 64 bit domain sizes.

## example
Contains an example using all functions available in the implementation.

## src
Contains the implementation of classes and functions used.

## tests
